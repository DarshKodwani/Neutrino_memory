\begin{abstract}

We calculate the gravitational memory effect when a spherically symmetric shell of energy passes through a spacetime region. In particular, this effect includes a longitudinal component, such that two radially separated geodesics pick up a relative velocity proportional to their separation. Such a measurement will allow us to obtain the total energy released by a supernova explosion in the form of neutrinos. We study the possibility to measure such an effect by space-based interferometers such as LISA and BBO, and also by astrophysical interferometers such as pulsar scintillometry.

\section{Introduction and Summary}

The recent detection of gravitational waves \cite{GW1509} has proved that gravitational waves leave an oscillating pattern in the amplitude of waveforms measured at detectors such as LIGO. It is also known that this is not the only effect that is potentially detectable. Strong gravitational waves imply a large flow of energy. Just like any other flow of energy, it leads to a gravitational memory effect \cite{Christodoulou_effect,GW_memory}. 

\begin{figure}[b]

\caption{Schematic of the effect being considered by a neutrino shell passing through the interferometer. The points $A,B,C$ represent ends of the interferometer of arm length $d$. The three points $A,B$ and $C$ will pick up velocities $v_A, v_B$ and $v_C$ respectively after the shell crosses them. They are all different since they cross the shell at different locations.}
\label{fig:1}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The memory effect discussed in \cite{Christodoulou_effect,GW_memory} causes permanent relative displacements between geodesics. It contains only transverse-traceless components and can leave an imprint in an interferometer. In this paper, we will introduce another memory effect that is different in two ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item It has a longitudinal component. The transverse-traceless limitation only applies to freely-propagating changes of the metric (i.e gravitational waves). While coupled to matter, which often have longitudinal (density) waves, it is natural to have an accompanying longitudinal change in the metric.
\item Instead of displacements, it causes permanent changes in relative velocities between geodesics, with magnitudes proportional to their separations.
\end{itemize}

In terms of the dynamics, a change in velocity is higher order than a change in distance. This however does not mean that our effect is harder to measure. The conventional gravitational memory effect needs a physical event that significantly breaks spherical symmetry to be detectable whereas our effect does not and therefore it can occur more generally. In addition, a change in velocity implies a distance change that grows in time even after the initial effect. That is an advantage for some detection methods.  

We will present a simple and natural occurrence of this effect. During a supernova explosion (SNe), most of the energy is released in a highly relativistic shell of neutrinos. As illustrated in Fig.\ref{fig:1}, when a neutrino shell passes through, the three free-falling points $A$, $B$ and $C$, will pick up different velocities due to the change of geometry. If $AB$ and $BC$ are two arms of an interferometer, we will see a time-dependent change after the shell passes through. Note that this is purely a geometric change which happens even without the three actual objects. We will demonstrate this by showing that it is possibility to detect the same effect using pulsar interferometry, in which two parallel light rays get different time-delays after being hit by a neutrino shell. 

The SKA telescope is expected to detect thousands of pulsars, \cite{MSPpopulation}, and one of them might be close enough to a SN explosion to provide us with a good estimation of the total energy in the neutrino shell of the explosion. Currently there is no other way to obtain such information. Thus in addition to direct neutrino detections such as in Super-Kamiokande \cite{SuperKSN}, this memory effect can provide a new handle on constraining the explosion mechanism. 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section \ref{RelV} we derive the change in velocities with the Israel Junction Conditions (IJC) \cite{Isr66}, treating the neutrino shell as a co-dimension-one delta function. In section \ref{obs} we discuss potential observation of such an effect by experiments that are currently being planned such as LISA and BBO. The final section \ref{sec-scint} discusses how an astrophysical interferometer formed by pulsar scintillometry can measure the same effect.

The dark black line is the null trajectory of the neutrino shell.}
\label{fig:2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

We assume the geometry of the spacetime is governed by the SN progenitor star. We assume the star is not rotating very rapidly and thus the surrounding spacetime is parametrized by the Schwarzschild metric,
\begin{equation}
	ds^2_i = - \left( 1 - \frac{2M_i}{r} \right) dt_i^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{2M_i}{r} \right)^{-1} dr^2 + r^2 d \Omega_2^2,	\label{SCH}
\end{equation}
where are working in units with $G = c =1$. After the star explodes, it emits a shell of neutrinos carrying energy $\delta M$. The metric surrounding the original star then changes since the mass has changed. In particular the $i$ index used above to denote the ``initial" metric is replaced by $f$ to denote the ``final" metric with a smaller mass $M _f = M_i -\delta M$. Notice that the time component of the metric is different in both geometries whereas the radial component is the same as it corresponds to the radius of a two sphere separating the two geometries.  Since we are describing the shell as a delta function travelling at roughly the speed of light it will follow a null geodesic. The null vector of the shell can be written in both metrics as follows\footnote{One could write this vector in different ways and still have it satisfy the null normalization condition, however, the fact the shell has some surface area with a \emph{fixed} radius, the two vectors must have the same radial component and this enforces the given form of the time component.}
\begin{equation}
	\Sigma^\mu_{(i,f)} = \left( \left( 1 - \frac{2M_{(i,f)}}{r} \right)^{-1}, 1, 0, 0 \right).	\label{sigma}
\end{equation}
We choose a coordinate chart in which the interferometer points are initially at rest (denoted by the points $A,B,C$ in figure \ref{fig:1}) and are described by the following geodesic
\begin{equation}
	\zeta^\mu_{i} = \left( \left( 1 - \frac{2M_i}{r} \right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}, 0, 0, 0 \right).	\label{zeta}
\end{equation}
The $r$ will be different for points $A,B$ and $C$ as shown in figure \ref{fig:1}. After the shell has crossed the points we expect $\zeta$ to have a velocity component. This can be found using the IJC, 
\begin{equation}
	 g_{\mu \nu} \Sigma^\mu_{(i)} \zeta_{(i)}^\nu = \hat{g}_{\mu \nu} \Sigma^\mu_{(f)} \zeta_{(f)}^\nu,	\label{0IJC}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{g}_{\mu \nu}$ represents the metric of the ``final" spacetime and $g_{\mu \nu}$ is the metric of the initial spacetime. This expression comes from demanding the continuity of geodesics from one geometry to another and was used in \cite{PhysRevD.93.103006} to calculate a similar effect. Substituting Eqs (\ref{sigma}, \ref{zeta}) into Eq (\ref{0IJC}) gives the final vector for the interferometer, to leading order,
\begin{equation}
	\zeta^\mu_{f} = \left( \left( 1 - \frac{2M_f}{r_{crossing}} \right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}, - \frac{\delta M}{r_{crossing}}, 0, 0 \right).	\label{5}
\end{equation}
Note that $\frac{\delta M}{r_{crossing}}$ is a coordinate velocity and to convert to proper velocity it will need to be multiplied by a factor of $\left( 1 - \frac{2M}{r_{crossing}} \right)^\frac{1}{2}$. $r_{crossing}$ is a fixed distance at which the shell crosses a point. For $A$ it is $r_0$, for $B$ it is $r_0 + d$ and for $C$ it is $\approx r_0 + d$ as well.\footnote{The exact expression is $r_0 \left( 1 + \frac{2d}{r_0} + \frac{2d^2}{r_0^2} \right)^\frac{1}{2}$ but we are working to leading order so we can make the given approximation.}

\subsection{The relationship between proper time and distance}\label{concept}

The distance change is measured by an interferometer. The interferometer calculates the distance by sending photons to a target and measuring the time it takes for them to come back. To demonstrate this we consider the simple case shown in figure \ref{fig:3}. Two freely falling points $A$ and $B$ are in the gravitational field of an object with mass $M$. The two points have a separation $d$ between them at $T_0$. The distance of the first point from the mass $M$ is $R_0$. The trajectories of the two points (as shown in figure (\ref{fig:3})) are given by
\begin{equation}
	R_A(t) = R_0 - \frac{1}{2} \frac{M}{R_0^2} t^2,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	R_B(t) = R_0 - \frac{1}{2} \frac{M}{(R_0 + d)^2} t^2.
\end{equation}
The time at which the photon reaches $R_B$ is $T$. We can calculate $T$ using the metric in Eq (\ref{SCH}) with mass $M$. Setting $ds^2 = 0$ for the photons gives

\begin{equation}
	\int^T_{T_0} \ dt = \int^{R_B}_{R_A} \ \left( 1 - \frac{2M}{r} \right)^{-1} dr 
\end{equation}
We take $\frac{M}{r_0^2}\ll 1$ and so we can approximate that $r$ doesn't change with time to do the integral,

\begin{equation}
	T = R_B(T_0) - R_A(T_0) + 2M \ln \left( \frac{R_B(T_0) - 2M}{R_A(T_0) - 2M} \right).	\label{11}
\end{equation}
Note that there is some ambiguity over what time the $R$'s on the right hand side of Eq (\ref{11}) should be evaluated at. Looking ahead to the problem we will construct in the later section, we assume\footnote{Note that $T - T_0 \sim \mathcal{O}(d)$.} $T - T_0 \ll T_0$ and so to leading order we can evaluate the $R$'s at $T_0$. If we only keep leading order terms in Eq (\ref{11}), we can drop the log term as well.

\begin{equation}
	T \approx d + \frac{1}{2} \frac{M}{(R_0 + d)^2} T_0^2 - \frac{1}{2} \frac{M}{R_0^2} T_0^2 = d + \mathcal{O}(R_0^{-3}).
\end{equation}
The proper time $\tau = \left( 1- \frac{2M}{r} \right)^\frac{1}{2} T$. Thus we see that for a weak gravitational field, $\tau$ is the distance $d$ to leading order. This shows that whenever we measure the proper time interval it takes for photons to travel a distance between two points, we are also measuring the distance between two points.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Full interferometric calculation}

Now lets move on the more realistic case of the interferometer shown in figure \ref{fig:2}. We parametrize the trajectory of each point in a piecewise form. For point $A$ we have

\begin{eqnarray}
	r_A(t)  & = & r_0 - \frac{1}{2} \frac{M}{r_0^2} t^2, \hspace{85mm} (t \leq 0)	\nonumber	\\
	&  = & r_0 - \frac{1}{2} \frac{M-\delta M}{r_0^2} t^2 - \frac{\delta M t}{r_0} \left( 1 - \frac{2(M -\delta M)}{r_0} \right)^\frac{1}{2}. \hspace{30mm} (t>0)	\label{rA}
\end{eqnarray}
$t=0$ is defined to be the time when the shell crosses point $A$ and the distance $r_A(0) = r_0$. For $t<0$ the only term that contributes to the trajectory is the acceleration of point $A$ towards mass $M$. For $t>0$ there is still the acceleration term but the mass is different since the shell has carried $\delta M$ away. Along with that there is a term that corresponds to the velocity change coming from the shell crossing. The trajectory of point $B$ is given by.

\begin{eqnarray}
	r_B(t) & = & r_0 + d - \frac{1}{2}\frac{M}{(r_0+d)^2} t^2,  \hspace{73mm}	(t \leq d) \nonumber	\\
	& = & r_0 +d - \frac{1}{2} \frac{M}{(r_0 + d)^2}d^2 - \frac{1}{2} \frac{M - \delta M}{(r_0 +d)^2}(t - d)^2 \nonumber	\\
	& - & \frac{1}{2} \frac{\delta M}{r_0 + d}  \left( 1 - \frac{2(M -\delta M)}{r_0} \right)^\frac{1}{2} (t-d) - \frac{Md}{r_0^2}(t-d). \hspace{30mm} (t>d)	\label{rB}
\end{eqnarray}
For $t <d$ there is just the acceleration of the point towards mass $M$. After $t>d$ the shell has crossed and now there is a change in distance in the time $d$ (to leading order the shell takes time $d$ to go from $r_0$ to $r_0 + d$) that the point is accelerating towards $M$. This is the second term in the expression. The next term corresponds to the acceleration of the point towards mass $M-\delta M$. The next line contains the velocity terms for this point. The first term is the term that comes from the IJC. The second term is the velocity picked up by this point in the time the shell reaches it. Using these trajectories we can calculate how the distance between points $A$ and $B$ changes as a function of time. 

 A photon is released at time $t$ after the shell has crossed point $A$. Using Eqs (\ref{rA}, \ref{rB}) we can calculate the time, $\bar{\tau}$, it takes for this photon to go to point $B$ and come back to point $A$. The full calculation is presented in the appendix. The leading order result is
 
 \begin{equation}
	 \bar{\tau} = 2d \left( 1 + \frac{\delta M}{r_0} - \frac{M - \delta M}{r_0} \right)
\end{equation}
Note that there is no time dependence in this expression. In fact, the time dependence will come in at $\mathcal{O}(r_0^{-3})$ in this case.\footnote{See appendix where we show that there is no time dependence at second order.} As shown in section \ref{concept} this expression for $\bar{\tau}$ will the leading order distance between $A$ and $B$. The change in distance, $\Delta L_{AB}$, between the two points is given by subtracting the proper time it takes for a photon to complete this journey without any shell crossing from $\bar{\tau}$.

\begin{equation}
	\Delta L_{AB} = \bar{\tau} - 2d \left( 1 - \frac{2M}{r_0} \right)^\frac{1}{2} = 4 d \frac{\delta M}{r_0} 
\end{equation}
Since this is a permanent change in the distance - it is nothing but a memory effect. Next we show an effect which is much more interesting since it grows with time.
\\
\\
The interferometer arm that goes from $B$ to $C$ will see the distance between these two points change. In fact, this distance is much simpler to calculate. The points $B$ and $C$ will feel the same acceleration to $M$ to leading order and so we can simply look at the change in velocities due to shell crossing. The velocities for points $B$, $v_B$, and $C$, $v_C$, have the same magnitudes to leading order but are pointing in slightly different directions. From the geometry of figure \ref{fig:1} we see that the relative change in velocity between the two points along the vertical direction will be $v_C \sin \theta$ where $\sin \theta \approx d/r_0$. The distance change between the two points, $\Delta L_{BC}$, is therefore given by 

\begin{eqnarray}
	\Delta L_{BC} &=& -\left( \frac{ \delta M}{r_0 + d} \left( 1 - \frac{2(M- \delta M)}{r_0+d} \right)^\frac{1}{2}\sin \theta \right) t 
	\nonumber \\
	&=& - d \frac{\delta M}{r_0^2} t + \mathcal{O}(r_0^{-3})~.
\end{eqnarray}
Since they both fall toward the SN, they are getting closer to each other thus $\Delta L_{BC}$ is \emph{decreasing}. Thus we have found a memory effect that grows with time. This effect is suppressed compared to $\Delta L_{AB}$ by a factor of $r_0^{-1}$ but since it grows with time there will be times for which this effect will be dominant.

We draw the lens to be behind the SN, but it could have been in front of it and the effect is the same.}
%%\label{fig:4}
%%\end{center}
%%\end{figure}
%
%An interferometer works by sending photons from a source to another point that reflects them back to the source. Usually this is done using two arms of equal length so that if the length of one of the arms increases the photons that leave the source will not arrive back in phase with the photons that went along the other arm (as there will be a path difference in their travel distance) and it is this phase change that is observed in an interferometer. There is an equivalent way of calculating this effect which is to count the number of wavelengths of the photon along its total trajectory. In general, a photon trajectory, $k^\mu$, is of the form
%
%\begin{equation}
%	k^\mu = (E, p_r, p_\theta, p_\phi),
%\end{equation}
%for a photon moving in a radial direction $p_r = \frac{1}{\lambda}$ where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the photon. A photon moving in a Schwarzschild geometry will have the following four vector 
%
%\begin{equation}
%	k^\mu(\omega_\infty, M, r) = \omega_\infty \left(  \frac{1}{1 - \frac{2M}{r}}, \sqrt{1 - \frac{b^2}{r^2} \left( 1 - \frac{2M}{r} \right)}, \frac{b}{r^2}, 0 \right),
%\end{equation}
%$\omega_\infty$ is a normalization factor that corresponds to the frequency of the photon as observed by an observer at rest sitting infinitely far away and $b$ represents the impact parameter of the photon. By setting $b= 0$ we get
%
%\begin{equation}
%	k^\mu(\omega_\infty, M, r) = \omega_\infty \left( \frac{1}{1 - \frac{2M}{r}}, 1 , 0 , 0  \right).
%\end{equation}
%This photon has wavelength $\lambda_\infty = \frac{1}{\omega_\infty}$. As an illustration, we consider the effect a neutrino shell has on just one arm of an interferometer, i.e two free falling points separated by distance $r_a - r_b = d$,\footnote{This is representative of the two points $A$ and $B$ in figure \ref{fig:1} as the two points are assumed to be in line with the SN.} as shown in the bottom part of figure \ref{fig:2}. A photon leaves from $r_a$ with four vector $k^\mu_i(\omega_a)$ and goes to point $r_b$. The frequency measured, $\omega_{O1}$, by an observer at $r_b$ of this photon is
%
%\begin{equation}
%	\omega_{O1} = - g_{\mu \nu}(M_i, r_b) k^\mu(M_i, \omega_a, r_b) \zeta^\nu_i(M_i, r_b).	\label{9}
%\end{equation}
%This must be the same as the frequency observed for a photon coming from the opposite direction which, in figure \ref{fig:2}, is denoted by $k^\mu_i(\omega_b)$, 
%
%\begin{equation}
%	\omega_{O1} = - g_{\mu \nu}(M_i, r_b) k^\mu(M_i, \omega_b, r_b) \zeta^\nu_i(M_i, r_b).	\label{10}
%\end{equation}
%Since the photon is travelling in the opposite direction in this case, the velocity component of the $k^\mu_i(\omega_b)$ will have the opposite sign
%
%\begin{equation}
%	k^\mu(\omega_b) = \omega_b \left( \frac{1}{1 - \frac{2M}{r}}, -1, 0, 0 \right).
%\end{equation}
%By equating Eq (\ref{9}) and (\ref{10}) we see $\omega_a = \omega_b$ and therefore the wavelengths of the photons must be the same. Since the distance between the two points, $d$, does not change, the total number of wavelengths traversed by the photons along there paths is a constant number, $N_i$, given by
%
%\begin{equation}
%	N_i = \frac{d}{\lambda_a} = d\omega_a = d \omega_b
%\end{equation}
%When a neutrino shell crosses the two points, they pick up a velocity as is shown in Eq (\ref{5}). This means both, the frequency of the photons and the distance between the two points will change. Let's begin by calculating the change in the frequency. Consider the photon $k^\mu_f(\omega_1)$ emitted from a distance $r_1$, shown in the upper part of figure \ref{fig:2}. An observer $O2$ at $r_2$ will measure the frequency of photon $k^\mu_f(\omega_1)$ to be
%
%\begin{eqnarray}
%	\omega_{O2} & = & -g_{\mu \nu}(M_f, r_2) k^\mu(M_f, \omega_1, r_2) \zeta^\nu(M_f, r_2) 	\nonumber	\\
%	& = & \left( 1 + \frac{M_f + \delta M}{r_2} + \frac{2M_f \delta M}{r_2^2} \right) \omega_1.
%\end{eqnarray}
%Similarly the photon $k^\mu_f(\omega_2)$ has the measured frequency
%\begin{eqnarray}
%	\omega_{O2}  & = & -g_{\mu \nu}(M_f, r_2) k^\mu(M_f, \omega_2, r_2) \zeta^\nu(M_f, r_2) 	\nonumber	\\
%	& = & \left( 1 + \frac{M_f - \delta M}{r_2} - \frac{2M_f \delta M}{r_2^2} \right) \omega_2.
%\end{eqnarray}
%Combining these two equations gives, to second order in small quantities, 
%
%\begin{equation}
%	\omega_1 = \left( 1- \frac{2 \delta M}{r_2} - \frac{4 M_f \delta M - M_f^2 + \delta M^2}{r_2^2} \right) \omega_2.
%\end{equation}
%The distance, $d$, will also change as both the points will have different velocities. Therefore the distance, $d_1$, traversed by photon $k^\mu_f(\omega_1)$ is
%
%\begin{equation}
%	d_1 = r_2 - r_1 = d - \frac{\delta M}{r_b} t_2 + \frac{\delta M}{r_a} t_1.
%\end{equation}
%We want to get everything in terms of one time $t_1$, so lets find $t_2$ in terms of $t_1$
%
%\begin{equation}
%	t_2 = t_1 + d -\frac{\delta M}{r_a} t_1 + \frac{\delta M}{r_b} t_2
%\end{equation}
%
%\begin{equation}
%	t_2 \left( 1 - \frac{\delta M}{r_b} \right) = t_1 + d - \frac{\delta M t_1}{r_a}
%\end{equation}
%which to leading order is
%
%\begin{equation}
%	t_2 = t_1 + d + \mathcal{O}(r^{-1}).
%\end{equation}
%and so $d_1$ becomes,
%
%\begin{equation}
%	d_1 = d\left(1 - \frac{\delta M }{r_a} - \frac{\delta M t_1 }{r_a^2} + \mathcal{O}(r_a^{-3}) \right).
%\end{equation}
%Therefore the number of wavelengths, $N_{f1}$, traversed by photon $k^\mu_f(\omega_1)$ is
% 
% \begin{eqnarray}
% 	N_{f1} & = & \frac{d_1}{\lambda_1} = \frac{d\left(1 - \frac{\delta M }{r_a} - \frac{\delta M t_1 }{r_a^2} \right)}{\lambda_1}
%\end{eqnarray}
%So we see that there is a term that increases linearly with time and so the number of wavelengths increases linearly with time. Similarly we can calculate the number of wavelengths, $N_{f2}$, traversed by the photon $k^\mu_f (\omega_2)$ on its way back to $r_3$. The distance $d_3$ traveresed by the photon is
%
%\begin{equation}
%	d_3 = r_2 - r_3 = d - \frac{\delta M}{r_a} t_3 + \frac{\delta M}{r_b} t_2
%\end{equation}
%
%Again lets get $t_3$ in terms of $t_2$ (which we know how to write in terms of $t_1$), 
%
%\begin{equation}
%	t_3 = t_2 + d + \frac{\delta M}{r_a} t_3 - \frac{\delta M}{r_b} t_2
%\end{equation}
%
%\begin{equation}
%	t_3 \left( 1 - \frac{\delta M}{r_a} \right) = t_2 + d - \frac{\delta M }{r_b} t_2
%\end{equation}
%
%and so to leading order
%
%\begin{equation}
%	t_3 = t_2 + d = t_1 + 2d + \mathcal{O}(r^{-1})
%\end{equation}
%
%which is again expected. So $d_3$ becomes
%
%\begin{eqnarray}
%	d_3 & = & d - \frac{\delta M d}{r_a} - \frac{\delta M t_1}{r_a} + \frac{\delta M}{r_b} t_1	\nonumber	\\
%	& = & d \left( 1 - \frac{\delta M}{r_a} \right) + \frac{\delta M d}{r_a^2} t_1
%\end{eqnarray}
%
%And the number of wavelengths $N_{f2}$ is
%
%\begin{equation}
%	N_{f2} = \frac{d \left( 1 - \frac{\delta M}{r_a} \right) + \frac{\delta M d}{r_a^2} t_1}{\lambda_2}
%\end{equation}
%
%where $\lambda_2 = \frac{1}{\omega_2}$.

%We have seen in the previous section how the effect of the nuetrino shell crossing the points manifests itself to an interferometer. Here we expand on this calculation and apply it to a general interferometer like the one shown in figure \ref{fig:1}. 
%\\
%\\
%The relative velocity between the ends of a horizontal interferometer, $A$ and $B$, that is in radial alignment with the SN as shown in figure \ref{fig:1} is given by
%\begin{equation}
%	\Delta L_{AB} =  (v_A - v_B)t = d \frac{\delta M}{r_E^2}  t+ \mathcal{O}(r_E^{-3})~.
%\end{equation}
%where $v_A$ and $v_B$ are the velocities picked up by points $A$ and $B$ after shell crossing and $t$ is the time passed after shell crossing. Note that since the point $A$ picks up a larger velocity toward the supernova, $\Delta L_{AB}$ is \emph{increasing}.
%
%The total velocities for points $B$ and $C$ have the same magnitudes but are pointing in slightly different directions. It is easy to work out the geometry to see that
%\begin{eqnarray}
%	\Delta L_{BC} &=& -\left( \frac{ \delta M}{r_E} \sin \theta \right) t 
%	\\ \nonumber
%	&=& - d \frac{\delta M}{r_E^2} t + \mathcal{O}(r_E^{-3})~.
%\end{eqnarray}
%Here $\theta\approx (d/r_E)$ is the angle between point $B$ and $C$ to the SN. Since they both fall toward the SN, they are getting closer to each other thus $\Delta L_{BC}$ is \emph{decreasing}\footnote{This is important; if the distance $\Delta L_{BC}$ was also increasing, since the magnitude of the increase is the same as $\Delta L_{AB}$, we would not see an effect since the photons in the interferometer arms would still have the same phase when they come back to point $B$.}.
%
%In summary, we have an interferometer whose one arm decreases in length while the other increases, resulting in a detectable change in the interference pattern. 
%\begin{center}
%\begin{tabular}{| c | c |} 
%\hline
%$\Delta L_{AB}$ &  $  \Delta L_{BC} $  \\   \hline 
%$\frac{\delta M d}{r_E^2} t$ & $ -\frac{\delta M d}{r_E^2} t$  \\ 
%\hline 
%\end{tabular}
%\end{center}
%Note that for the conventional memory effect, the signal is maximized when the interferometer is face-on to the source. In our case, a face-on interferometer would get zero signal, since both arms will be decreasing in length. Our signal is maximized by having a longitudinal arm, in this case $AB$.

%\section{Change in proper time}
%\label{Ptime}
%Interferometers like LIGO measure a change in the phase of light. The phase takes the form $\omega \tau$ where $\omega$ is the frequency of the photon and $\tau$ is the proper time traversed by the photon clock. In \cite{Pulsar_acc} we showed that there is no change in frequency in the case when the objects are aligned, so that would be in the case when the interferometer is oriented radially such as $AB$. For simplicity lets just look at the radial case of $AB$. Since there is no change in frequency, the change in phase will be given by the change in proper time (which is also intuitively pleasing as it corresponds to a change in a physical quantity which is the proper length between the two points). 
%\begin{figure}[h!]
%\begin{center}
%\includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{shellcrossing.pdf}
%\caption{This is showing the change in proper time before and after shell crossing for an interferometer in the radial direction of the SN, so that would correspond to the points $A$ and $B$ in figure \ref{fig:1}. The blue lines represent the motion of photons and the orange line is the neutrino shell.}
%\label{fig:2}
%\end{center}
%\end{figure}
%By carefully expanding the equations of motion of a radial photon in a Schwarzschild metric one can find the expressions for proper time before, $\Delta \tau_i$, and after, $\Delta \tau_f$, shell crossing. The full calculation is presented in the appendix, the result we are interested in is the difference in the proper times, $\Delta \tau \equiv \Delta \tau_i - \Delta \tau_f$, and it is given by
%\begin{equation}
%	\Delta \tau=  \frac{2d}{r_E^2} ( \frac{3}{2} (M_i^2 - M_f^2) - \frac{d \delta M}{2} - 3 M_f \delta M - \frac{\delta M^2}{2} \right - t \delta M  ).
%\end{equation}
%This shows that there is no change in proper time to $\mathcal{O}(r_E^{-1})$ which is what is expected and there is a term that grows linearly with time at $\mathcal{O}(r_E^{-2})$ which is in agreement with results presented in section \ref{RelV}.

 \section{Observation with Space-based Interferometers}
\label{obs}
Taking the generic form of the change in distance as $\Delta L \sim \frac{\delta M d}{r_0^2} t$ we can estimate the distance a SN would have to be from the interferometer to have an observable change in strain, which is a unitless number quantifying the amount of space-time distortion.
\begin{equation}
h \sim \frac{\Delta L}{d} \sim \frac{\delta M t}{r_0^2}~.
\label{eq-strain}
\end{equation} 
Since our strain grows linearly with time, we do not expect detections from ground based experiments as for those setups the three points $A,B,C$ cannot remain in free fall for a long enough amount of time such that the signal builds up to an observable value. 

If we plot our effect on the strain-frequency diagram \cite{GWcurves} that is usually used to compare different interferometers, it will be a 45-degree line. Thus the first point at which the sensitivity curve of a device crosses with a 45-degree line will give the best chance for our effect being detected. In all these estimations, we take $\delta M$ to be a faction of a solar mass, and take the corresponding Schwarzschild radius to be $1~km$ for simplicity.

For LISA, the best observing frequency is $\sim 0.5 \times10^{-2} Hz$ with a sensitivity in strain $\sim 10^{-21}$. Using Eq.~(\ref{eq-strain}), we can solve for the distance to the SN, $r_0$, for our effect to be detectable.
\begin{eqnarray}
	r_0 & = &  \left(  \frac{\delta M}{h} t \right)^\frac{1}{2} \label{Meas}	\\
	& = &  \left( \frac{1 \ km}{10^{-21}} \times 10^7 \ km \right)^\frac{1}{2} \approx 10^{14} \ km = 10 \ ly.
\end{eqnarray}
This is clearly too close. It has been estimated that only once in $10^8$ years will a SN go off within a distance of $30 \ ly$ \cite{EllSch93}.\footnote{And if that happens, it might kill us.} By a naive volume scaling, an explosion within 10 $ly$ only occurs once every billion years.

If we look at the Big Bang Observer (BBO) instead, the best observing frequency is $\sim 0.5 Hz$ with a sensitivity in strain $\sim 10^{-24}$. First of all, this frequency range does not have as many background signals from compact binaries, making it a much better device to measure our effect. The improved sensitivity gives a value for $r_0$ of $\sim 100 \ ly$. This is a factor of $10^3$ increase in the volume for detectable events, thus improves the expectation of one SN that is within $10 \ ly$ to occur in less than a million years . That is unfortunately still a long shot.

In this type of simple estimation, we cannot go lower in the frequency. The exact duration of the neutrino-shell passage is not known, but we do no expect it to be much less than a second. Thus for higher frequencies, the co-dimension-one delta function approximation breaks down, and the effect will be weaker than Eq.~(\ref{eq-strain}).

Finally, we expect 2 to 3 SN per century in our galaxy and we can assume that the next SN would be at a distance comparable to the galactic diameter of $\sim 10^5 \ ly$. If we are going to measure such effect at $1 \ Hz$, Again using Eq.~(\ref{eq-strain}), we find
\begin{equation}
	h = \frac{ 1~km \times ~ (3\times10^8~m)}{(10^5~ly)^2}\sim 10^{-30}~.
\end{equation}
This requires a measurement of the strain that is six orders of magnitude better than BBO and is not yet achievable by interferometers that are currently being planned. 

\section{Observation with Pulsar Scintillation}
\label{sec-scint}

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=10cm]{Lens.pdf}
\caption{Geometry of the astrophysical interferometer formed by pulsar scintillometry. Due to scattering or lensing, the image we see is an interference pattern of two light rays represented by the blue lines. If the separation of the two light rays has a component along the longitudinal (radial) direction from the SN, the spacetime distortion of the neutrino shell will change the interference pattern we see. We draw the lens to be behind the SN, but it could have been in front of it and the effect is the same.}
\label{fig:4}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

We learned from the previous section how difficult it is to measure the spacetime distortion. It is strongly suppressed by a factor of $r_0^{-2}$, which is proportional to the energy density of the shell when it reaches us. If we can have an interferometer much closer to the SN, the signal will be larger.

In this final section we discuss a possibility to do just that. It is known that the images of many astronomical bodies scintillate \cite{PulsarScint}. A general reason for scintillation is that due to scattering or lensing, we receive multiple light rays from the same objects. These light rays are very close to each other, so they cannot be individually resolved and have to interfere. The scintillation pattern we see is the time dependence of their interference. If we consider two light rays from a faraway pulsar which happen to pass by a SN progenitor, as illustrated in Fig.\ref{fig:4}, they can probe the spacetime distortion when it explodes. 

The scintillation/interference pattern is directly related to the path lengths of these light rays. The change in such path length during a SN explosion has been worked out in \cite{Olum:2013gza}
\begin{equation}
	\Delta t = 2\delta M \left[ \ln \left(1 + \frac{t^2}{b^2} \right) - \frac{t^2}{b^2 + t^2} \right].
\end{equation}
Here $b$ is the impact parameter as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:4}, the shortest distance between the light ray and the SN. $t$ is the proper time on earth, with $t=0$ the time we directly observe the SN explosion. $\delta M$ is the total energy of the neutrino shell, and $\Delta t$ is the resulting time shift. A photon which should have reached the earth at time $t$, will arrive earlier at $(t-\Delta t)$ instead.

When the separation between two light rays has a component in the radial direction from the SN, $\Delta b$, there will be a nonzero relative change between their path lengths.
\begin{equation}
	(\Delta t|_b - \Delta t|_{b+\Delta b}) \approx 
	\frac{\partial \Delta t}{\partial b} \Delta b 
	= - \frac{4\delta Mt^4}{b(b^2 + t^2)^2} \Delta b~.
	\label{eq-change}
\end{equation}
We can see that this effect grows from zero and approaches an asymptotic value,
\begin{equation}
	(\Delta t|_b - \Delta t|_{b+\Delta b}) 
	\longrightarrow \frac{4\delta M \Delta b}{b}~,
\end{equation}
at a characteristic time scale given by $b$. 

We estimate $b$ by assuming that the next SN is somewhere near the galactic centre. A sample of $\sim 9000$ pulsars from the SKA catalog in \cite{MSPpopulation} shows that among those pulsars, the shortest $b$ is about $10\ ly \sim 10^{14} \ km$. $\Delta b$ is related to the scattering-broadening of images. We use the data from \cite{BowBel13} that was observed on a scattering screen near the galactic centre. Scaling the frequency to $1\ GHz$ which is usually a good window to observe pulsar signals. We found that such a scattering screen can produce images separated by $\Delta b\sim 1000A.U. \sim 10^{10} \ km$. We again use $\delta M \sim 1 \ km$, and combining all these numbers we get $(\delta M \Delta b / b) \sim 1 \ m$. This is comparable to the wavelength at $1 \ GHz$, thus making the change in interference pattern easy to detect. Therefore, if we can monitor the pulsar scintillation pattern over ten years after a SN explosion we should see an order one change in the scintillation pattern predicted by Eq.~(\ref{eq-change}).

\appendix

\section{Proper time for a photon going from point A to B and coming back}

In this calculation we first calculate the time, $t_1$, it takes for the photon released at time $t$ from point $A$ to reach point $B$. Then we calculate the time, $t_2$, it takes for the photon to come back to point $A$. The quantities are clearly defined in figure \ref{fig:2}. The final result is obtained by adding these times and converting to proper time. 
\\
\\
Lets start by finding $t_1$,

\begin{eqnarray}
	t_1 & = & r_A(t) -  r_B(t + t_1) 	\nonumber	\\
	& = & d + \underbrace{\frac{1}{2} \frac{M-\delta M}{r_0^2} t^2}_{T1} + \underbrace{\frac{\delta M}{r_0} \left( 1 - \frac{2(M-\delta M)}{r_0} \right)^\frac{1}{2} t}_{T2} - \underbrace{\frac{1}{2} \frac{M}{(r_0+d)^2} d^2}_{T3} - \underbrace{\frac{1}{2} \frac{M- \delta M}{(r_0+d)^2} (t+t_1-d)^2}_{T4}	\nonumber	\\
	& - & \underbrace{\frac{\delta M}{r_0 + d} \left( 1 - \frac{2(M-\delta M)}{r_0} \right)^\frac{1}{2} (t+t_1-d)}_{T5} - \underbrace{\frac{M d}{(r_0+d)^2} (t + t_1 -d)}_{T6}.	\label{t1full}
\end{eqnarray}

Lets interpret each term individually. $T1$ is the acceleration of point $A$ until the photon is released at time $t$. Similarly $T2$ is the proper velocity of point $A$. $T3$ accounts for the acceleration of point $B$ in the time it takes the shell to go from $A$ to $B$. $T4$ is the acceleration of point $B$ after the shell has crossed it. $T5$ is the velocity change from the shell crossing point $B$. $T6$ is the velocity gained while the point is accelerating before the shell crosses it. 
We can expand Eq (\ref{t1full}) to leading order in small quantities. 

\begin{eqnarray}
	t_1 & = & d - \frac{1}{2} \frac{Md^2}{(r_0 + d)^2} - \frac{\delta M}{r_0} (t_1 - d) \label{t1A2} \\	
	& + &  \frac{\delta M}{r_0} t - \frac{\delta M}{r_0}t	\label{t1A3}	\\
	& + & \frac{1}{2} \frac{M- \delta M}{r_0^2} t^2 - \frac{\delta M(M- \delta M)t}{r_0^2} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{M- \delta M}{r_0^2} t^2 - \frac{\delta M}{r_0} \left( 1 - \frac{d}{r_0} \right) \left( 1 - \frac{M - \delta M}{r_0} \right) t - \frac{Mdt}{r_0^2}	\label{t1A4}	\\	
	& = & d - \frac{1}{2} \frac{Md^2}{r_0^2} - \frac{\delta M^2d}{r_0^2} - \frac{M- \delta M}{r_0^2} dt	\label{t1A5}
\end{eqnarray}
This is equation is structured such that \ref{t1A2} contains the terms that are independent of time. \ref{t1A3} has the leading order terms, i.e $\mathcal{O}(r_0^{-1})$, that depend on time. We see these cancel and there is no time dependence at leading order. \ref{t1A4} contains second order terms that depend on time. The final line \ref{t1A5} shows the final result. Throughout these expansions we use $t_1 = d + \mathcal{O}(r_0^{-2})$. 

Similarly we calculate the time, $t_2$, it takes for a photon to go from $r_B$ to $r_A$. 

\begin{eqnarray}
	t_2 &  = & r_A(t+t_1 + t_2) - r_B(t+t_1) 	\nonumber	\\
	& = & d + \frac{1}{2} \frac{M- \delta M}{r_0^2} (t + t_1 + t_2)^2 + \frac{\delta M}{r_0} \left( 1 - \frac{2(M- \delta M)}{r_0} \right)^\frac{1}{2} (t + t_1 + t_2) - \frac{1}{2} \frac{Md^2}{(r_0 + d)^2} \nonumber	\\
	& - & \frac{1}{2}\frac{M- \delta M}{(r_0 + d)^2} (t + t_1 - d)^2  - \frac{\delta M}{r_0 + d} \left( 1 - \frac{2(M- \delta M)}{r_0 + d} \right)^\frac{1}{2} (t + t_1 - d) - \frac{Md}{(r_0+d)^2} (t + t_1 -d )
\end{eqnarray}
Again we expand this to leading order in small quantities (following the same structure as $t_1$). 

\begin{eqnarray}
	t_2 & = & d + \frac{\delta M}{r_0} (t_1 + t_2) - \frac{\delta M}{r_0} (t_1 - d) - \frac{1}{2} \frac{Md^2}{r_0^2}	\label{t2A7}	\\
	& + & \frac{\delta M}{r_0}t - \frac{\delta M}{r_0} t	\label{t2A8}	\\
	& + & \frac{1}{2} \frac{M- \delta M}{r_0^2} t^2 + 2 \frac{M- \delta M}{r_0^2} dt - \frac{\delta M(M - \delta M)}{r_0^2} t - \frac{1}{2} \frac{M - \delta M}{r_0^2} t^2 + \frac{\delta M dt}{r_0^2} + \frac{\delta M(M-\delta M)t}{r_0^2}  - \frac{Md}{r_0^2} t	\label{t2A9}	\\
	& = & d + \frac{2 \delta Md}{r_0} +\frac{\delta M^2 d}{r_0^2} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{Md^2}{r_0^2} + \frac{M - \delta M}{r_0^2} dt
\end{eqnarray}

Adding $t_1$ and $t_2$ to get the total time it takes for the photon to go from $A$ to $B$ and then come back 

\begin{equation}
	t_1 + t_2 = 2d \left( 1 + \frac{\delta M}{r_0} \right) + \mathcal{O}(r_0^{-2}).
\end{equation}

This is a coordinate time and we need the proper time, $\bar{\tau}$, which is 

\begin{equation}
	\bar{\tau} = \left( 1 - \frac{M- \delta M}{r_0} \right) (t_1 + t_2) = 2d \left( 1+ \frac{\delta M}{r_0} - \frac{M - \delta M}{r_0} \right) + \mathcal{O}(r_0^{-2}).
\end{equation}


%\section{Full calculation change in proper time}
%
%We would expect that the any difference in proper times would appear at $\mathcal{O}(r_E^{-2})$ thus all quantities are expanded to this order in the calculation. 
%
%\subsection{Before Shell Crossing}
%
%We start by defining the metric
%
%\begin{equation}
%ds^2 = -\left(1-\frac{2M_i}{r}\right)dt^2 + \frac{dr^2}{1-\frac{2M_i}{r}}+r^2d\Omega_2^2~.
%\end{equation}
%
%The two end-points of an interferometer arm, $r_1(t), r_2(t)$ are defined as
%
%\begin{eqnarray}
%r_1(t) &=& r_{E}~, \ \ \ r_2(t) = r_{E}+d~.
%\end{eqnarray}
%
%The equation of motion for outgoing photons travelling radially is obtained from the metric by setting $ds=0$,
%
%\begin{eqnarray}
%t-t_0 &=& r-r_0 + 2M_i\ln\frac{r-2M_i}{r_0-2M_i} \\ \nonumber
%&=& d + 2M_i\frac{d}{r_E} -M_i\frac{d}{r_E}
%\left( \frac{d}{r_E}-\frac{4M_i}{r_E} \right)~.
%\label{eq-dt1}
%\end{eqnarray}
%
%In the last step we plug in $r_0=r_E$, $r = r_E+d$. Likewise, an incoming null-ray has an equation of motion
%
%\begin{eqnarray}
%t-t_0 &=& r_0-r + 2M_i\ln\frac{r_0-2M_i}{r-2M_i} \\ \nonumber
%&=& d + 2M_i\frac{d}{r_E} - M_i\frac{d}{r_E}
%\left( \frac{d}{r_E}-\frac{4M_i}{r_E} \right) ~.
%\end{eqnarray}
%
%Here we used $r_0 = r_E+d$, $r = r_E$. Thus the total coordinate time it takes for a light ray to come back at $r_1$ is
%
%\begin{equation}
%\Delta t = 2d + 4M_i\frac{d}{r_E} - 2M_i\frac{d}{r_E}
%\left( \frac{d}{r_E}-\frac{4M_i}{r_E} \right)~.
%\end{equation}
%
%The total proper time traversed by the first end of the interferometer arm in the time it takes the photon to travel the length of the arm and come back is 
%
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\Delta \tau_i &=& \sqrt{1-\frac{2M_i}{r_E}}\Delta t  \\ \nonumber
%&=& 2d \left(1-\frac{M_i}{r_E} - \frac{M_i^2}{2r_E^2}\right) 
%\left[ 1+\frac{2M_i}{r_E} - \frac{M_i}{r_E}\left( \frac{d}{r_E} - \frac{4M_i}{r_E} \right) \right] \\ \nonumber
%&=& 2d
%\left(1 + \frac{M_i}{r_E} + \frac{3}{2}\frac{M_i^2}{r_E^2} - \frac{M_id}{r_E^2}\right)~.
%\end{eqnarray}
%
%\subsection{After Shell Crossing}
%
%The metric after shell crossing comes from the mass $M_f$,
%\begin{equation}
%ds^2 = -\left(1-\frac{2M_f}{r}\right)dt^2 + \frac{dr^2}{1-\frac{2M_f}{r}}+r^2d\Omega_2^2~,
%\end{equation}
%with $(M_i-M_f)=\delta M$ the neutrino shell mass. Assuming that $r_1$ crosses the shell at $t=0$, we have\footnote{In theory there is also the acceleration of the interferometer however that will be a higher order affect thus we ignore it.}
%\begin{eqnarray}
%r_1(t) &=& r_E - \frac{\delta M}{r_E} \left( 1 - \frac{2M_f}{r_E} \right)^\frac{1}{2}t~,
%\end{eqnarray}
%where $\left( 1 - \frac{2M_f}{r_E} \right)^\frac{1}{2}$ is the conversion factor between proper velocity and coordinate velocity, since this will be a higher order effect and will always accompany $\frac{\delta M}{r_E}$ this term will only affect terms of $\mathcal{O}(r_E^{-2})$. On the other hand, $r_2$ crosses the shell later. We can only derive that by first knowing the outgoing null-ray trajectory,
%\begin{eqnarray}
%t-t_0 = r-r_0 + 2M_f\ln\frac{r-2M_f}{r_0-2M_f}~.
%\label{eq-null1out}
%\end{eqnarray}
%Plugging $t_0=0$, $r_0 = r_1(0) = r_E$, $r = r_2 = r_E+d$, we obtain the crossing time,
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\tilde{t} &=& d + 2M_f\ln \frac{r_E+d-2M_f}{r_E-2M_f} \\ \nonumber
%&=& d + 2M_f\frac{d}{r_E} - M_f\frac{d}{r_E}\left( \frac{d}{r_E} - \frac{4M_f}{r_E} \right)~.
%\end{eqnarray}
%Using this we can calculate $r_2(t)$ 
%\begin{eqnarray}
%r_2(t) &=& r_E + d - \frac{\delta M}{r_E+d} \left( 1 - \frac{2M_f}{r_E+d} \right)^\frac{1}{2}(t-\tilde{t}) \\ \nonumber
%&=& r_E + d - \frac{\delta M}{r_E}(t-d) + \frac{\delta M}{r_E^2} ((M_f + d)t + (M_f - d)d)
%\end{eqnarray}
%Now, for a light ray that starts from $r_1$ at a later time $t_0$, we solve where $r_2$ crosses the null ray by substituting $r_0 = r_1(t_0) = r_E - \frac{\delta M}{r_E}t_0~$ and $r &=& r_2(t) = r_E + d - \frac{\delta M}{r_E}(t-d) + \frac{\delta M}{r_E}\frac{d}{r_E}(t-d+2M_f)$ into Eq (\ref{eq-null1out}). A further approximation we may use is $t_0\gg d\approx(t-t_0)$. Thus when a term is already second order, we ignore the difference between $t$ and $t_0$. We can then start to solve the crossing time at $r_2$, while carefully keeping all the expansions up to the second order.
%
%\begin{eqnarray}
%& & \Delta t_{out} \equiv  t - t_0 = d - \frac{\delta M}{r_E}(t - t_0 - d) + \frac{\delta M M_f}{r_E^2} (t - t_0 -d)	\nonumber	\\
%&  & + \frac{\delta M}{r_E}\frac{d}{r_E}(t-d+2M_f) \label{eq-SolveCross} \nonumber	\\
%& & + 2M_f\ln\left(1+\frac{d}{r_E}-\frac{2M_f}{r_E} -\frac{\delta M(t-d)}{r_E^2} \right) 
%\nonumber \\ \nonumber
%& & - 2M_f\ln\left(1-\frac{2M_f}{r_E} -\frac{\delta Mt_0}{r_E^2} \right)
%\\ \nonumber
%&=& d - \frac{\delta M}{r_E}(t - t_0 - d) + \frac{M_f \delta M d}{r_E^2} + \frac{\delta M t_0}{r_E^2}(d-M_f) \\ \nonumber
%& & + 2M_f \left[ \frac{d}{r_E}-\frac{2M_f}{r_E} -\frac{\delta M(t-d)}{r_E^2}  - \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{d}{r_E}-\frac{2M_f}{r_E} \right)^2 \right] \\ \nonumber
%& & - 2M_f \left( -\frac{2M_f}{r_E} -\frac{\delta Mt_0}{r_E^2} - \frac{2M_f^2}{r_E^2} \right) + \frac{\delta M M_f t}{r_E^2} ~.
%\end{eqnarray}
%This leads to
%\begin{eqnarray}
%& & \Delta t_{out} \left(1 + \frac{\delta M}{r_E} - \frac{\delta M M_f}{r_E^2}\right) = 
%d + 2M_f\frac{d}{r_E}  \nonumber	\\
%& & - M_f\frac{d}{r_E} \left( \frac{d}{r_E}-\frac{4M_f}{r_E} \right) 	\nonumber	\\
%& & + \frac{\delta M}{r_E}d + \frac{\delta Md}{r_E^2} (t_0+3M_f)~.
%\end{eqnarray}
%
%Compare this to Eq.~(\ref{eq-dt1}), there are only three differences, and two of them have clear physical meanings. The last term on the right-hand-side is the total extra distance between the two end-points, since their velocities are slightly different. The extra factor on the left-hand-side comes from the fact that both end-points are falling toward the center with roughly identical velocity, so it takes a light ray less time to go from inside to outside. On the other hand, the outside endpoint did not pick up this velocity at $t=0$, but at $t\sim d$. That leads to the second last term which will cancel the previous factor at the leading order. The last two things will of course be reversed in the reflection, while the distance increase stays the same. An incoming null-ray has the trajectory
%
%\begin{eqnarray}
%t_0 - t = r-r_0 + 2M_f\ln\frac{r-2M_f}{r_0-2M_f}~.
%\end{eqnarray}
%
%This allows us to calculate the radial coordinates of the end points of the interferometer arms 
%\begin{eqnarray}
%r_0 &=& r_2(t_0) = r_E +d - \frac{\delta M}{r_E}(t_0-d) \nonumber	\\
%& + & \frac{\delta M}{r_E^2} (d(M_f -d) + t_0(M_f+d)) ~, \nonumber \\
%r &=& r_1(t) = r_E - \frac{\delta M}{r_E}t - \frac{M_f \delta M}{r_E^2} ~.
%\end{eqnarray}
%and the time it takes for an incoming photon to cross the arm, 
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\Delta t_{in} & \equiv & t-t_0 = d + \frac{\delta M}{r_E}(t-t_0+d)	\nonumber	\\
%& +& \frac{\delta M}{r_E^2} \left( - M_f t + t_0 (M_f + d) + d(M_f -d) \right)
%\nonumber  \\
%& & +2M_f\ln\left( 1+\frac{d}{r_E} - \frac{2M_f}{r_E} - \frac{\delta M}{r_E^2}(t_0-d) \right)
%\nonumber \\ \nonumber
%& & -2M_f\ln\left( 1 - \frac{2M_f}{r_E} - \frac{\delta M}{r_E^2}t \right)
%\end{eqnarray}
%Compare this with Eq.~(\ref{eq-SolveCross}), the log terms are identical up to the higher order difference in $t$ and $t_0$ which we can ignore.
%\begin{eqnarray}
%& & \Delta t_{in}\left(1-\frac{\delta M}{r_E} + \frac{M_f \delta M}{r_E^2} \right) =
%d + 2M_f\frac{d}{r_E} 
%\nonumber	\\
%& & - M_f\frac{d}{r_E} \left( \frac{d}{r_E}-\frac{4M_f}{r_E} \right) 
%+ \frac{\delta M}{r_E}d \nonumber	\\
%& +&  \frac{\delta Md}{r_E^2} (t_0-d+2M_f)~.
%\end{eqnarray}
%Combining them, the total duration in coordinate time is
%\begin{eqnarray}
%& & \Delta t = \Delta t_{out} + \Delta t_{in} \nonumber \\
%&=& d \left(1 - \frac{\delta M}{r_E} + \frac{\delta M^2}{r_E^2} \right) 	\nonumber	\\
%& \times & \left[ 1 + \frac{2M_f}{r_E} + \frac{\delta M}{r_E} -\frac{M_f}{r_E}\left( \frac{d}{r_E}-\frac{4M_f}{r_E} \right) + \frac{\delta M (t_0+2M_f)}{r_E^2} \right] \nonumber  \\
%&+& d \left(1 + \frac{\delta M}{r_E} + \frac{\delta M^2}{r_E^2} \right) \nonumber	\\
%& \times & \left[ 1 + \frac{2M_f}{r_E} + \frac{\delta M}{r_E} -\frac{M_f}{r_E}\left( \frac{d}{r_E}-\frac{4M_f}{r_E} \right)  + \frac{\delta M (t_0-d+2M_f)}{r_E^2} \right]  \nonumber	\\
%&=& 2d [ 1 + \frac{2M_f}{r_E} + \frac{\delta M}{r_E} -\frac{M_f}{r_E}\left( \frac{d}{r_E}-\frac{4M_f}{r_E} \right) \nonumber	\\
%&+ & \frac{\delta M (t_0+2M_f-d/2)}{r_E^2} +\frac{\delta M^2}{r_E^2} ]~.
%\end{eqnarray}
%
%Next we convert this coordinate time into proper time, 
%
%\begin{eqnarray}
%\Delta \tau_f &=& \int_{t_0}^{t_0+\Delta t}
% \sqrt{\left(1-\frac{2M_f}{r_1}\right)dt^2 - \left(1-\frac{2M_f}{r_1}\right)^{-1}dr^2} \nonumber	
% \\ 
%&=& \int_{t_0}^{t_0+\Delta t} 
%\sqrt{\left(1 - \frac{2M_f}{r_E - \frac{\delta M}{r_E}t}\right) - \frac{\delta M^2}{r_E^2} }
%~dt  \nonumber	\\
%&=& \left(1 - \frac{M_f}{r_E} - \frac{\delta M^2}{2r_E^2} - \frac{M_f^2}{2 r_E^2} \right)
%\Delta t \nonumber \\
%&=& 2d ( 1 + \frac{M_f}{r_E} + \frac{\delta M}{r_E} - \frac{\delta M M_f}{r_E^2} + \frac{M_fd}{r_E^2}+ \frac{3}{2} \frac{M_f^2}{r_E^2}	\nonumber	\\
%& + & \frac{\delta M (t_0+2M_f-d/2)}{r_E^2} + \frac{\delta M^2}{2r_E^2} ). \label{123}
%\end{eqnarray}
%
%Finally, we arrive at the difference in proper time, $\Delta \tau = \Delta \tau_i - \Delta \tau_f$, 
%
%\begin{equation}
%	\Delta \tau=  \frac{2d}{r_E^2} \left( \frac{3}{2} (M_i^2 - M_f^2) - \frac{d \delta M}{2} - 3 M_f \delta M - \frac{\delta M^2}{2} - t \delta M  \right).
%\end{equation}
